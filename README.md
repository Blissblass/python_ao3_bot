# Welcome!

This is a simple AO3 discord bot written in python that checks for updates every hour and notifies the user on discord! Why, you ask? Nothing other than human laziness of course!

It can:

* Check works regularly (once every 5 minutes) for any updates
* Save and remove works from the checking queue
* Alert the user in the corresponding discord channel when an update is detected
* Return meaningful error messages when something goes wrong

Soon to come (probably):

* A search function that lets you search and find works in a Discord channel (less work to do, yknow?)
